# Additions
## Angel Block
- Inspired from [Extra Utilities' Angel Block](https://ftbwiki.org/Angel_Block), place the block where you click

## Angel Wall
- Similar to Angel Block but wall version, it also force-replace walls so it can be also used to easily replace underground walls (as hammers don't break em for some reason)

## Biome Lockbox
- Generally i don't like how having a corruption world make you unable to have Crimson-exclusive content so this item allow you have the Crimson Chest exclusive item even if you have a corruption world or vice-versa.

## Height Fixed Statues
- Because all statues are [placeStyles](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-Tile#multiple-styles) of a 2x3 base statue, even if the statue is actually 2x2, it still have a hitbox of 2x3. I decided to fix that but as i couldn't fix it directly without having to touch advanced stuff like [IL editing](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Expert-IL-Editing), i decided to go the method that is more of my level which is re-creating the statues with the correct height and then making a conversion recipe. The following are the height fixed statues:

[Bat Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Bat_Statue)


[Worm Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Worm_Statue)

[Buggy Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Buggy_Statue)

[Mouse Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Mouse_Statue)

[Fish Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Fish_Statue)

[Snail Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Snail_Statue)

[Frog Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Frog_Statue)

[Turtle Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Turtle_Statue)

[Piranha Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Piranha_Statue)

[Shark Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Shark_Statue)

[Anvil Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Anvil_Statue)

[Bird Statue](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Statues#Bird_Statue)

## Life Juice
- An idea i had. If the player's life go below 100, it will heal him back up, one minute cooldown

## Magnet Potion
- An idea i had for a potion. It give the Hand of Creation's item-attraction range for 45m (mainly for building)

## Mana Juice
- An idea i had for [Mana Fruit Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3048126617). Give the mana needed to use the magic item if you don't have enough, 10 seconds cooldown. This item don't exist if Mana Fruit Mod isn't installed

# Tweaks
### Old One's Army
- Even tho [Monk Belt](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Monk%27s_Belt) and [Huntress Buckler](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Huntress%27s_Buckler) are obtained in hardmode and dropped from harder minibosses, they give the same sentries bonus (1) and summon damage bonus (10%) as the pre-hardmode "easy" boss. I decided to double it as it just make more sense

## Guide Voodoo Doll
- I don't like how you can summon the Wall of Flesh by accident so this tweak make the WOF only spawn if the Guide Voodoo Doll is directly dropped by the player

## ShellPhone
- An extension for [Cellphone Portal mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2848951322) that make all the ShellPhone's tp mode leave a return portal. Without Cellphone Portal mod, the Home tp mode is the only one that don't leave a return portal

## Summoning Potion
- Make the summoning potion also give an additional sentry slot

## Light Pets
- I hate how the Light Pets become useless when they are inside of blocks (Their light are completely blocked off) so after i found out that Suspicious Looking Tentacle have a "fix" for it, i decided to give it to all the other light pets. I also replaced the Shadow Orb and Wisp in a Bottle's control keys to their own keys as using the player's control key is problematic imo

Note: For some reason, unlike the Shadow Orb i wasn't able to perfectly replace Wisp in a Bottle's control keys so it only move when you are holding one of the original keys and there also other minor issues that i wasn't able to fix or know what causes them.

## Slice of Cake
- I found weird how Slice of Cake looks like one of the perma-buff tiles (War Table, Bewitching Table etc) yet it give a timed buff so i decided to make it permanent like the rest

## Mana Fruit
- Make the Mana Fruit Mod's mana fruit emit a blue light so you can easily find it just like the mod Heart Crystal & Life Fruit Glow do with Heart Crystals and Life Fruits. Don't take effect if Mana Fruit Mod isn't installed

## Lava Moss
- Because i wanted to decorate my base with Lava Moss and for some reason the lava moss drop only 11.11% of the time while using the Paint Scraper, i decided to make the Lava Moss drop 100% of the time with any tool

Note: I couldn't find a way to make Lava Moss stop dropping the Lava Moss when using Paint Scraper, you can get 2 Lava Moss with 11.11% chance while using the Paint Scraper... Bug or feature?

## Tinkerers Workshop
- The Tinkerers Workshop looks like it can have stuff put above it yet you can't so i decided to allow you to put stuff above it

Note: For some reason the middle shelf became solid just like the top.

## Trap Door
- I hate how Smart Doors only works for Doors (I mean Trap Door have Door on it, right?) so i decided to make trap doors also have such feature. Press S (or whatever key you use to go down) while over the trap door for it to open and go some tiles away from it to automatically close. Press W when below it or while holding Space for it to open from below. This works regardless of the Smart Doors' setting

## Favorite Item
- I hate how when you switch accessories and whatnot, they don't keep their previous favorited state so this somewhat fix it. Only works when left-clicking, doesn't work for right-click because i mostly use left-click when switching accessories and whatnot

## Sell & Trash
- I hate how limited and brokey Smart Trash is and also how only when you are selling stuff, the Shift + Left-Click isn't the key you use to insta-move the item to the inventory (Chests and whatnot works like this) so i created a key to delete stuff (Delete) and when in a shop inventory, Shift + Left-Clicking insta-sell stuff. Only works correctly when Smart Trash is disabled

# Recipes
## The following are the recipes of the mod or non-common way of obtaining the items
- Gold Chest - 8 Gold bar, 2 Iron/lead bar, Workbench. Add a recipe for Gold Chest as it is my fav storage chest type and i hate how it doesn't have a recipe
- Soaring Insignia - Fledgling Wings, Spooky Wings, Festive Wings, Cosmic Car Key/Drill Containment Unit, Demon Wings/Angel Wings, 100 Soul of Flight, Crystal Ball and you need to be in Space, Near Water, Lava, Honey and Shimmer also Classic Mode/Journey Mode only. I would like to have infinite flight in Classic Mode/Journey Mode too so i decided to create a recipe for it. It doesn't exist in Expert or Master Mode as you can get it in there
- Water Bucket - Empty Bucket and near Water (Sinks also counts for this condition). You can fill Bottles using Sinks but you can't fill Water Buckets from sinks? Inconsistence fixed
- Flymeal - Gold Broadsword/PlatinumBroadsword, Stink Potion and near Honey. Alternative Flymeal recipe because stinkbug is a pain to get
- Angel Block/Angel Wall - Stone Block, Giant Harpy Feather, Workbench. Angel Block and Wall's recipe, the Angel Block and Wall are also interchangeable between each other
- Adamantite Forge/Titanium Forge - 7 Adamantite Bar/Titanium Bar, Hellforge, Mythril Anvil/Orichalcum Anvil. Why you can't craft Adamantite Forge/Titanium Forge with bars when bars are just the processed version of the ore? weirdness fixed
- Greater Healing Potion - Healing Potion, 3 Pixie Dust, Crystal Shard, Placed Bottle/Alchemy Table. Lesser Healing Potion are used to craft the Healing Potion and Greater Healing Potion is used to craft Super Healing Potion. Why the Healing Potion aren't used to craft the Greater Healing Potion? Inconsistence fixed
- Height Fixed Statues - Vanilla Statue, Heavy Workbench. The recipe for Height Fixed Statues are just a conversion recipe of the vanilla statue aka Vanilla Statue>Height Fixed Statue
- Magnet Potion - Bottled Water, Rock Lobster, Iron ore/Lead ore, Placed Bottle/Alchemy Table. - Magnet Potion's recipe
